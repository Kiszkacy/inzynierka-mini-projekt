## Setup


#### Configuring Godot with Your IDE
If you are using Rider as your IDE for Godot, you will need to install two essential plugins:

- Godot Support: This plugin provides features tailored for Godot Engine development, enhancing your workflow within Rider.
- GDScript Plugin: GDScript language support is crucial for efficient coding in Godot. This plugin ensures syntax highlighting, code completion, and other language-specific features in Rider.

If you are using Visual Studio the process is similar, requiring the installation of specific plugins that support Godot Engine.


#### Importing the Project into Godot
To import this project into Godot Engine open Godot Editor, click ``Import`` then navigate to and select the ``project.godot`` file from this directory.

#### Opening the Project in Your IDE
To open this project in Rider:

Click ``Import``, navigate to and select the ``.sln`` file from this directory.
Rider will load the project, allowing you to start coding and debugging seamlessly.
Ensure your IDE is properly configured and all necessary plugins are installed to facilitate smooth integration with Godot Engine.

If you are using Visual Studio this process is exactly the same.
